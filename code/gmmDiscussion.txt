######## Experiments about different M, everything else is default:

M is 8 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 6 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 4 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 2 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0

Cannot find any conclusion from above, therefore, decrease maxIter to 1

M is 8 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 6 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.9375
M is 4 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.90625
M is 2 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.75

As we can see from the data, as M decrease, the accuracy decreases.
As we increase the model number, we have more complex model that can handle more situations, therefore, the accuracy increase.

########  Experiments about different MaxIter, everything else is default:

M is 8 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 8 MaxIter is 10 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 8 MaxIter is 5 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 8 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 1.0

Cannot find any conclusion from above, therefore, decrease maxIter to 1

M is 2 MaxIter is 20 Accuracy is 1.0
M is 2 MaxIter is 10 Accuracy is 0.96875
M is 2 MaxIter is 5 Accuracy is 0.90625
M is 2 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.625

As we can see from the data, as maxIter decrease, the accuracy decreases.
As the number of iteration decrease, the model is trained with less effort, therefore, the accuracy would go down.

########  Experiments about different S, everything else is default:

S is 32 M is 2 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.5625
S is 16 M is 2 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.8125
S is 10 M is 2 MaxIter is 1 Accuracy is 0.9

As we can see from the data, as S decrease, the accuracy increase.
As the number of speakers increase, the difficulty also increase, therefore, the accuracy decrease.


1. We can have more complex models to train with more iterations. (Increase both M and maxIter).
2. If the logLik for given utterance is very low for all the models, then it may not exist in training sets.
3. we can parse the data and generate a bunch of features and use neural networks to train a model. After that we may able to identify a given speaker.
